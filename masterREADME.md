# C++ Programming Fundamentals Archive

This repository is a curated collection of projects completed during my initial transition into Computer Science. It demonstrates my progression from basic syntax to complex logical problem-solving.

## Featured Implementations

### Yahtzee Scoring Logic
- **Goal:** Determine the highest possible score from a set of 5 dice.
- **Key Skills:** Boolean logic, function modularization, and pattern recognition (Straights, Full House, etc.).

### Movie & Quiz Drivers (File I/O)
- **Goal:** Parse external `.txt` data files to populate object arrays.
- **Key Skills:** Sequential file reading, data normalization, and class instantiation.

### Array & Search Utilities
- **Goal:** Efficiently manipulate and retrieve data from parallel arrays.
- **Key Skills:** Circular rotation algorithms, linear search, and boundary validation.
